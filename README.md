## Introduction

By default, when you create a member account as part of your Organization, AWS automatically creates `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` in the member account.

The role grants admin permissions to access the member account to delegated IAM users in the master account.

In the master account you need to create a Policy to grant permissions to IAM users to assume `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` in the member account.

This module does the following:

1. Creates an IAM Group
2. Adds the provided IAM users to the Group
3. Creates a Policy to grant permissions to the IAM users in the master account to assume `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` in the member account
4. Attaches the Policy to the Group


Users who are members of the Group will be able to assume the role and administer the member account by going here:

(change `XXXXXXXXXXXX` to the ID of the member account)

```
https://signin.aws.amazon.com/switchrole
                ?account=XXXXXXXXXXXX
                &roleName=OrganizationAccountAccessRole
                &displayName=Dev
```


<br/>

__NOTE__: Member accounts that you invite to join your Organization (that are not part of your Organization) do not automatically get `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` created.
You can use [terraform-aws-organization-access-role](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-organization-access-role) module to create `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` role in an invited member account.

## Usage



> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation 
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic 
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.



```hcl
module "organization_access_group" {
  source            = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-organization-access-group.git?ref=master"
  namespace         = "cp"
  stage             = "dev"
  name              = "cluster"
  user_names        = ["User1","User2"]
  role_arns         = {
    "cp@dev" = "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXX:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
  }
  require_mfa       = "true"
}
```
